## Compiling the SCSS

These instructions are written assuming you already know a little about front-end dev and gulp.

Compile the SCSS into by having gulp and NPM installed.

If you have both of these you can run

> npm i

This will install all the required modules listed in the gulpfile.js.

Then you can just run

> gulp

and it will compile and minify the CSS
